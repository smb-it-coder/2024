JavaScript supports many Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, but it does have some limitations or differences compared to classical OOP languages like Java or C++. Here are the primary OOP concepts that JavaScript does not fully support or implements differently:

### **1. Classical Inheritance**

**Classical Inheritance** involves creating classes and using inheritance to extend these classes. In classical OOP languages, classes are blueprints for creating objects, and inheritance allows one class to inherit the properties and methods of another class.

**JavaScript’s Approach**:
- JavaScript uses **prototypal inheritance** instead of classical inheritance. Objects inherit directly from other objects through their prototype chain.
- **ES6 Classes**: JavaScript introduced `class` syntax in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), which provides a more familiar syntax for defining objects and inheritance. However, this is syntactic sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance, not a change in the underlying inheritance model.

**Example**:

**Classical Inheritance in Java (Traditional OOP Language)**:
```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

**Prototypal Inheritance in JavaScript**:
```javascript
function Animal() {}
Animal.prototype.makeSound = function() {
    console.log("Animal makes a sound");
};

function Dog() {}
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;
Dog.prototype.makeSound = function() {
    console.log("Dog barks");
};
```

### **2. Multiple Inheritance**

**Multiple Inheritance** allows a class to inherit from more than one class. This is common in some OOP languages like C++.

**JavaScript’s Approach**:
- JavaScript does not support multiple inheritance directly. Instead, it supports a single inheritance chain through prototypes.
- JavaScript uses mixins to achieve similar functionality. Mixins are objects that provide shared methods and properties, which can be "mixed into" other classes or objects.

**Example**:

**Mixins in JavaScript**:
```javascript
const CanFly = {
    fly() {
        console.log("Flying");
    }
};

const CanSwim = {
    swim() {
        console.log("Swimming");
    }
};

class Duck {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

// Mix in CanFly and CanSwim
Object.assign(Duck.prototype, CanFly, CanSwim);

const daffy = new Duck('Daffy');
daffy.fly(); // Flying
daffy.swim(); // Swimming
```

### **3. Private and Protected Members**

**Private and Protected Members**: In classical OOP languages, private and protected access modifiers control the visibility of class members.

**JavaScript’s Approach**:
- **Private Fields**: As of ECMAScript 2022, JavaScript supports private class fields using the `#` syntax.
- **Protected Members**: JavaScript does not have a built-in concept for protected members. Developers usually use naming conventions (e.g., prefixing with an underscore) to indicate that a member should not be accessed directly.

**Example**:

**Private Fields in JavaScript**:
```javascript
class MyClass {
    #privateField;

    constructor(value) {
        this.#privateField = value;
    }

    getPrivateField() {
        return this.#privateField;
    }
}

const instance = new MyClass(42);
console.log(instance.getPrivateField()); // 42
console.log(instance.#privateField); // SyntaxError
```

### **4. Interfaces**

**Interfaces** define a contract for classes, specifying methods that must be implemented. They are a feature of some OOP languages like Java.

**JavaScript’s Approach**:
- JavaScript does not have built-in support for interfaces. Instead, developers can use documentation and conventions to define expected methods and properties.

**Example**:

**Simulating Interfaces in JavaScript**:
```javascript
class Animal {
    makeSound() {
        throw new Error("Method 'makeSound()' must be implemented.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    makeSound() {
        console.log("Woof");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    makeSound() {
        console.log("Meow");
    }
}
```

### **Summary**

- **Classical Inheritance**: JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance but provides a class syntax for a more familiar look.
- **Multiple Inheritance**: JavaScript does not support multiple inheritance directly but uses mixins as an alternative.
- **Private and Protected Members**: JavaScript supports private fields but lacks built-in protected members.
- **Interfaces**: JavaScript does not have native support for interfaces; instead, developers use conventions and documentation.

While JavaScript’s approach to OOP differs from classical OOP languages, it provides powerful and flexible ways to handle object-oriented programming using prototypes and modern features introduced in recent ECMAScript versions.
