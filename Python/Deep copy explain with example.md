Certainly! A deep copy is a concept in programming where you create a new object that is a duplicate of an existing object, including all objects referenced by the original object. Unlike a shallow copy, which only copies the references to objects, a deep copy duplicates all nested objects, ensuring that changes to the copied object do not affect the original object and vice versa.

### Example in Python

Let's consider a scenario with nested lists (which can be thought of as objects containing other objects):

#### Original Object

```python
import copy

original_list = [1, 2, [3, 4]]
```

Here, `original_list` is a list that contains another list `[3, 4]`.

#### Shallow Copy

A shallow copy can be created using the `copy` module's `copy` function or by using list slicing:

```python
shallow_copy = copy.copy(original_list)
# or
# shallow_copy = original_list[:]
```

If you modify the nested list in `shallow_copy`, it will also affect `original_list` because the nested list is shared between the two.

```python
shallow_copy[2][0] = 'changed'
print(original_list)  # Output will be [1, 2, ['changed', 4]]
print(shallow_copy)   # Output will be [1, 2, ['changed', 4]]
```

#### Deep Copy

A deep copy can be created using the `copy` module's `deepcopy` function:

```python
deep_copy = copy.deepcopy(original_list)
```

If you modify the nested list in `deep_copy`, it will not affect `original_list` because the nested list is fully copied, not just referenced.

```python
deep_copy[2][0] = 'changed'
print(original_list)  # Output will be [1, 2, [3, 4]]
print(deep_copy)      # Output will be [1, 2, ['changed', 4]]
```

### Summary

- **Shallow Copy**: Creates a new object, but does not create new objects for nested objects. Changes to nested objects will reflect in both the original and copied objects.
- **Deep Copy**: Creates a new object and recursively copies all objects found in the original object, ensuring that the copied object is entirely independent of the original.

Deep copying is useful when you need to create a completely independent copy of an object, especially when the object contains mutable nested objects.
