## Communicating with a REST API: A Layman's Guide

**Imagine you're ordering food.**

You don't go into the kitchen and start cooking, right? You tell the waiter what you want (your order), and they bring you the food (your order fulfilled).

**A REST API is like a waiter for computers.**

Instead of food, computers exchange data. Instead of a waiter, you have a REST API.

### How it works:

1. **You (the computer) have a specific request.**
   * "I want a pizza with extra cheese."
   * This is called an HTTP request.

2. **You send the request to the API (the waiter).**
   * You tell the waiter your order.
   * This is done through an internet connection.

3. **The API (waiter) processes your request.**
   * The waiter takes your order to the kitchen.
   * The API sends your request to the computer that stores the data.

4. **The API sends you a response.**
   * The waiter brings you your pizza.
   * The API sends the requested data back to you.

### Types of requests:

* **GET:** Asking for something (like asking for a menu).
* **POST:** Creating something new (like ordering a pizza).
* **PUT:** Updating something (like changing your pizza order).
* **DELETE:** Removing something (like canceling your order).

### Example:

Let's say you have a website that shows you the weather.

* The website sends a GET request to a weather API.
* The API receives the request.
* The API fetches the weather data from a weather station.
* The API sends the weather data back to the website.
* The website displays the weather information.

**In essence, a REST API is a way for different computer programs to talk to each other and share information.**
