In JavaScript, a "closure" is a function that retains access to variables from its outer (enclosing) function even after that outer function has finished executing. Closures are a fundamental concept in JavaScript and are often used for data encapsulation, creating private variables, and maintaining state in an elegant way.

### How Closures Work

A closure is created when a function is defined inside another function and gains access to the variables of the outer function. The inner function "closes over" the variables of the outer function, preserving their state.

### Basic Example

Here's a simple example demonstrating how closures work:

```javascript
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0; // This is a private variable
  return function() {
    count += 1;
    return count;
  };
}

const counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter()); // Outputs: 1
console.log(counter()); // Outputs: 2
console.log(counter()); // Outputs: 3
```

In this example:
- `createCounter` is an outer function that defines a private variable `count`.
- It returns an inner function that has access to `count` and increments it each time it's called.
- Even after `createCounter` has finished executing, the returned inner function retains access to `count` due to the closure.

### Key Points About Closures

1. **Encapsulation:**
   - Closures allow you to encapsulate data. The inner function can access and modify the variables of the outer function, but those variables are not accessible from outside the outer function.

2. **State Persistence:**
   - Closures help in maintaining state. In the example above, each call to `counter()` maintains and updates the state of `count` because the inner function retains access to it.

3. **Private Variables:**
   - Closures can be used to create private variables. Since the inner function has access to the outer function's scope, the private data remains protected from the outside world.

4. **Memory Management:**
   - Closures can lead to higher memory usage because they keep references to the outer functionâ€™s scope, which can prevent garbage collection of those variables as long as the closure is accessible.

### Advanced Example

Closures are also useful in more advanced scenarios. For example, you can use them to create functions with different behavior based on their environment:

```javascript
function makeMultiplier(factor) {
  return function(number) {
    return number * factor;
  };
}

const double = makeMultiplier(2);
const triple = makeMultiplier(3);

console.log(double(5)); // Outputs: 10
console.log(triple(5)); // Outputs: 15
```

Here, `makeMultiplier` returns a function that multiplies its argument by a specified `factor`. Each call to `makeMultiplier` creates a new closure with its own `factor`, demonstrating how closures can encapsulate and preserve environment-specific information.

## IInd Example


function greeting(){
    let name = "Brij";
     let helloMsg = function(){
        str = `Hello ${name}!`
        console.log(helloMsg);
    }

    return  helloMsg();
}

greeting()

### Summary

Closures are a powerful feature of JavaScript that allow functions to retain access to variables from their outer scope even after the outer function has completed execution. They are essential for creating private variables, managing state, and building more modular and encapsulated code.
