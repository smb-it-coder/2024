In MySQL, both views and materialized views are used to simplify querying by presenting a virtual table or precomputed data. However, they operate differently:

### **View:**

1. **Definition:**
   - A view is a virtual table based on the result of a SQL query. It does not store the data itself; rather, it stores the SQL query that generates the data.

2. **Storage:**
   - No physical storage is allocated for a view. When you query a view, MySQL dynamically executes the underlying SQL query to produce the result.

3. **Data Freshness:**
   - Since views are essentially a saved SQL query, they always show the most up-to-date data from the underlying tables.

4. **Performance:**
   - The performance of a view depends on the complexity of the underlying query and the size of the data being queried. Since it doesn't store data, querying a view can be slower if the underlying query is complex.

5. **Updatability:**
   - Views can be updatable if they are simple enough and meet certain criteria. This means you can perform INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations on the view, and these changes will reflect in the underlying tables.

### **Materialized View:**

1. **Definition:**
   - A materialized view is a database object that contains the results of a query. Unlike a regular view, a materialized view stores the result set physically.

2. **Storage:**
   - The data from the query is stored on disk, which means it occupies physical storage space and is not dynamically generated each time you query it.

3. **Data Freshness:**
   - Materialized views do not automatically update when the underlying data changes. You need to manually refresh them to get the latest data. This refresh can be scheduled or triggered based on specific events.

4. **Performance:**
   - Since the data is stored physically, querying a materialized view can be faster compared to querying a regular view, especially if the view involves complex aggregations or joins. This is because the result is precomputed and saved.

5. **Updatability:**
   - Materialized views are generally not updatable. To reflect changes, you need to refresh the materialized view to reflect the latest data from the underlying tables.

### **Support in MySQL:**

- **Views:** MySQL supports views natively and allows you to create, use, and manage them easily.

- **Materialized Views:** MySQL does not support materialized views directly. However, you can achieve similar functionality by creating tables that store the precomputed results and manually refreshing them as needed.

In summary, while both views and materialized views serve to simplify data access, the key difference lies in how and when the data is stored and refreshed. Views provide real-time access to data with no storage overhead, whereas materialized views store precomputed results for faster access at the cost of needing manual updates.

Sure! Let's walk through a practical example using an e-commerce application to illustrate the differences between a view and a materialized view.

### **Scenario**

Imagine you have an e-commerce application with the following tables:

- **`products`**: Contains information about products.
- **`orders`**: Contains information about customer orders.
- **`order_items`**: Contains details of items within each order.

**Table Definitions:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE
);

CREATE TABLE order_items (
    order_item_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
);
```

### **Example 1: View**

Let's say you want to create a view that shows the total sales for each product.

**Creating the View:**

```sql
CREATE VIEW product_sales AS
SELECT p.product_id, p.name, SUM(oi.quantity * p.price) AS total_sales
FROM products p
JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_id, p.name;
```

**Usage:**

When you query the `product_sales` view, it dynamically calculates the total sales for each product based on the current data in the `products` and `order_items` tables.

```sql
SELECT * FROM product_sales;
```

**Characteristics of the View:**

- **Dynamic Data:** The total sales are computed in real-time based on the latest data in the `order_items` and `products` tables.
- **No Storage:** It doesn't consume additional storage as itâ€™s just a stored query.
- **Performance:** Performance depends on the underlying query. For large datasets or complex joins, querying the view might be slower.

### **Example 2: Materialized View**

Since MySQL does not support materialized views directly, you'll need to simulate one using a table and scheduled refreshes.

**Creating a Table for Materialized View:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE product_sales_materialized (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    total_sales DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
```

**Populating the Table:**

You need to populate this table with the initial data.

```sql
INSERT INTO product_sales_materialized (product_id, name, total_sales)
SELECT p.product_id, p.name, SUM(oi.quantity * p.price) AS total_sales
FROM products p
JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_id, p.name;
```

**Refreshing the Materialized View:**

To keep the data updated, you need to periodically refresh this table. This could be done using a scheduled event or a manual refresh:

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE product_sales_materialized;

INSERT INTO product_sales_materialized (product_id, name, total_sales)
SELECT p.product_id, p.name, SUM(oi.quantity * p.price) AS total_sales
FROM products p
JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_id, p.name;
```

**Usage:**

You query the `product_sales_materialized` table to get the precomputed data:

```sql
SELECT * FROM product_sales_materialized;
```

**Characteristics of the Materialized View:**

- **Static Data:** The data needs to be refreshed manually or via a scheduled process to reflect changes in the underlying tables.
- **Storage:** It occupies physical storage as it contains precomputed data.
- **Performance:** Querying this table is generally faster because the results are precomputed and stored.

### **Summary**

- **View (`product_sales`):** Shows real-time data by dynamically executing the query. No additional storage is needed, but performance can be affected by the complexity of the underlying query.

- **Materialized View (`product_sales_materialized`):** Stores precomputed results, which can be faster to query but requires manual or scheduled updates to reflect changes in the underlying data.

In practice, the choice between a view and a materialized view depends on the specific use case, data freshness requirements, and performance considerations.
