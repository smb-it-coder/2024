Let's consider a simplified example of an e-commerce application where deadlocks might occur due to concurrent transactions involving inventory management and order processing. Weâ€™ll walk through a scenario and illustrate how to handle it to avoid deadlocks.

### Scenario

Assume you have two primary tables:
1. **`inventory`**: Keeps track of stock levels for products.
2. **`orders`**: Records customer orders.

#### Table Definitions

```sql
CREATE TABLE inventory (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    stock INT
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    product_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES inventory(product_id)
);
```

### Step-by-Step Example

1. **Simulate a Deadlock Scenario**

   Consider the following two transactions:

   - **Transaction A**: Adds an order for a product and updates the inventory.
   - **Transaction B**: Updates the inventory and adds an order for the same product.

   Both transactions could potentially end up in a deadlock if they acquire locks in different orders.

   **Transaction A:**

   ```sql
   START TRANSACTION;

   -- Lock the `orders` table
   INSERT INTO orders (product_id, quantity) VALUES (1, 10);

   -- Wait to simulate some processing time
   SLEEP(5);

   -- Attempt to update the inventory
   UPDATE inventory SET stock = stock - 10 WHERE product_id = 1;

   COMMIT;
   ```

   **Transaction B:**

   ```sql
   START TRANSACTION;

   -- Lock the `inventory` table
   UPDATE inventory SET stock = stock - 5 WHERE product_id = 1;

   -- Wait to simulate some processing time
   SLEEP(5);

   -- Attempt to insert an order
   INSERT INTO orders (product_id, quantity) VALUES (1, 5);

   COMMIT;
   ```

   Here, **Transaction A** locks the `orders` table first and then tries to lock the `inventory` table, while **Transaction B** locks the `inventory` table first and then tries to lock the `orders` table. This can lead to a deadlock if both transactions are executed simultaneously.

2. **Avoiding Deadlocks**

   **Consistent Locking Order**: To avoid deadlocks, ensure all transactions acquire locks in the same order. For example, always lock `inventory` before locking `orders`.

   **Revised Transactions**:

   **Transaction A:**

   ```sql
   START TRANSACTION;

   -- Lock the `inventory` table first
   UPDATE inventory SET stock = stock - 10 WHERE product_id = 1;

   -- Insert into `orders` table
   INSERT INTO orders (product_id, quantity) VALUES (1, 10);

   COMMIT;
   ```

   **Transaction B:**

   ```sql
   START TRANSACTION;

   -- Lock the `inventory` table first
   UPDATE inventory SET stock = stock - 5 WHERE product_id = 1;

   -- Insert into `orders` table
   INSERT INTO orders (product_id, quantity) VALUES (1, 5);

   COMMIT;
   ```

   **Note**: Both transactions now lock the `inventory` table before the `orders` table, avoiding potential deadlocks.

3. **Implementing Retry Logic**

   In your application code, implement retry logic to handle deadlocks gracefully. Here's an example using Python with MySQL:

   ```python
   import time
   import mysql.connector
   from mysql.connector import Error

   def execute_transaction_with_retry(cursor, queries, max_retries=3):
       retries = 0
       while retries < max_retries:
           try:
               for query in queries:
                   cursor.execute(query)
               return
           except Error as e:
               if e.errno == 1213:  # Deadlock error code
                   retries += 1
                   time.sleep(1)  # Wait before retrying
               else:
                   raise

   # Database connection
   conn = mysql.connector.connect(
       user='user', password='password', host='localhost', database='ecommerce'
   )
   cursor = conn.cursor()

   # Define queries for the transaction
   queries = [
       "UPDATE inventory SET stock = stock - 5 WHERE product_id = 1",
       "INSERT INTO orders (product_id, quantity) VALUES (1, 5)"
   ]

   try:
       execute_transaction_with_retry(cursor, queries)
       conn.commit()
   except Error as e:
       print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
       conn.rollback()
   finally:
       cursor.close()
       conn.close()
   ```

4. **Monitoring and Analysis**

   Use MySQL tools to monitor and analyze deadlocks:

   - **Enable InnoDB Monitoring**: Ensure InnoDB is configured to provide status information.
   - **Check Deadlock Logs**: Regularly review the InnoDB status output:

     ```sql
     SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS;
     ```

     This command provides details about recent deadlocks and can help diagnose issues.

By following these practices, you can effectively manage and mitigate the risk of deadlocks in your e-commerce application.
